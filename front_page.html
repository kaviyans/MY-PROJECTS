                    Youngsters are in demand for R&D of the embedded system. The way that Innovative Learning Program Center in CIT is set up has made it really easy to explore new domains. There’s a lot more collaboration within the class, and that’s led to me learning lot of really interesting inter disciplinary technologies.
